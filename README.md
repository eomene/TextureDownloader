# DOCUMENTATION

## Install from Unity Package Manager (Recommended)

### USING GIT

Before you start, make sure you have git installed on your computer.
Open the Unity editor and navigate to the Package Manager by clicking on Window and then Package Manager.

Click on the + at the top of the Package Manager window and select Add package from git URL.

Enter the URL below into the text box and click Add. 
https://github.com/eomene/TextureDownloader.git

The SDK is now installed in your project, and you are ready to configure the SDK and make your first API calls.

### Using FULL REPO

If you do not have git installed on your computer. You can install the SDK by downloading the entire repository and pasting in the packages folder of your project.
You can download the entire repo by clicking Code and Download Zip

The SDK is now installed in your project, and you are ready to configure the SDK and make your first API calls.

## MAKING LOCAL TEXTURES AVAILABLE
### METHOD 1: 
This system can access local textures if you put all textures in the folder “Resources/CradaptiveTextures”. You can have multiple folders of this.
###METHOD 2: 
Create a new gameobject, attach the “CradaptiveTexturesDownloader” component to it. 
 
Click on the plus button and add your local textures you which to have available. 
Make sure to assign the sprite as well as the url or name you which to use as a key to access this sprite.
## GETTING TEXTURES FROM SERVER DATA
If you are using this tool with data that comes from a server. For example, you expect a json response with a url link. Just implement the interface in your base data class. 
### Example :
    [System.Serializable]
    public class CradaptiveSimpleData : ICradaptiveTextureOwner
    {
        public string name;
        /// <summary>
 /// Url for image or local name in the Downloaded textures dictionary (if you  have the image locally assigned)
        /// </summary>
        public string url { get => serialisedUrl; set => serialisedUrl = value; }

        public string serialisedUrl;
        /// <summary>
        /// Callback for when image is available
        /// </summary>
        public Action<Sprite> OnTextureAvailable { get; set; }
    }

Now in your prefab, you can easily ask for a texture by passing that data to the texture download system. By doing the following:
You only need to set the callback which expects an action with a sprite variable. This would be called as soon as a response returns. Note that if your texture is local. This should be almost instant. 

        public void Init(CradaptiveSimpleData cradaptiveSimpleData)
        {
            cradaptiveSimpleData.OnTextureAvailable = (spr) =>
            {
                if(image)
                image.sprite = spr;
            };
            CradaptiveTexturesDownloader.QueueForDownload(cradaptiveSimpleData);
        }

## GETTING TEXTURES FROM LOCAL DATA
If you intend to use the local textures, and have probably assigned the textures to the system or placed in the resources folder. You can easily access the textures anywhere by initializing a struct.

        public void Init()
        {
            TextureDownloadRequest textureDownloadRequest = new TextureDownloadRequest();
            textureDownloadRequest.url = url;
            textureDownloadRequest.OnTextureAvailable = (spr) =>
            {
                image.sprite = spr;
            };
            CradaptiveTexturesDownloader.QueueForDownload(textureDownloadRequest);
        }

You set the callback as usual. As well as the url or local name you have assigned. This way you don’t need to create a new class for every texture request.
